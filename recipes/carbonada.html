        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Definitely one of my favorite national foods, and specially one that i like to make often in winter! It's a warm and hearty meal that brightens the soul :) (also, pro tip, if you let it rest overnight it will taste even better!)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g of a relatively fat free <strong>beef</strong> cut.</li>
            <li>1 big <strong>onion</strong>.</li>
            <li>2 medium sized<strong>carrots</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 <strong>yellow bell pepper</strong> and half of a red one.</li>
            <li>1 small <strong>sweet potato</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 big <strong>potato</strong> or 2 medium ones.</li>
            <li>1 quarter of <strong>squash</strong>.</li>
            <li>Beef or vegetable <strong>broth</strong> as needed.</li>
            <li>3 peeled <strong>tomatoes</strong> or a can of them.</li>
            <li>1 or 2 <strong>corn cobs</strong>.</li>
            <li>Just a bit of <strong>salt</strong>.</li>
            <li>Oregano, paprika, hot pepper and cumin.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong> as nedeed.</li>
            <li>2 <strong>green onions</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First we start by cleaning the meat of the thicker fat. I like to leave a bit of the skin because it adds flavor. We cut it into cubes of about 1 x 1 cm.</li>
            <li>In a layer of oil, we sear it. We arrange it and leave it undisturbed until we start seeing blood coming out, then we move it around for a few minutes on high heat and remove it.</li>
            <li>We chop the onion and the pepper into small pieces. We sauté them in the cooking base.</li>
            <li>We cut the tomato into cubes so it’s visible. We add it, season it, and then add the meat. We cover it with broth and let it cook partially covered for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, we chop the rest of the vegetables. Everything into 1 x 1 cm cubes, except for the squash, which I chopped small. My idea was for it to dissolve during cooking and thicken the mixture. The corn is sliced thin.</li>
            <li>By now, the cooking has made the meat tender and reduced the liquid quite a bit. We add the vegetables, except for the corn. We add more broth to cover it. We let it cook, and when the vegetables are fully cooked, we add the corn and cook for a few more minutes (about 5 minutes). We turn off the heat and let it rest.</li>
            <li>We serve it with chopped parsley or, in my case, green onion. And the cold, where did it go?</li>
        </ol>
