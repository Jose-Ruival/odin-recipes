            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.</li>

            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
