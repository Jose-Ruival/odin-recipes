        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of divided <strong>peanut oil</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped <strong>shallot</strong>.</li>
            <li>One quarter of minced <strong>white onion</strong>.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of <strong>butter</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of <strong>ginger garlic paste</strong>.</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of <strong>lemon juice</strong>.</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of <strong>garam masala</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>ground cumin</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 <strong>bay leaf</strong>.</li>
            <li>One quarter cup of <strong>plain yogurt</strong>.</li>
            <li>1 pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>ground black pepper</strong> to taste.</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless <strong>chicken thighs</strong>, cut into bite size pieces.</li>
            <li>One quarter teaspoon of <strong>cayenne pepper</strong>, or to taste.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of <strong>cornstarch</strong>.</li>
            <li>One quarter cup of <strong>water</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saut√© shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
            <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
